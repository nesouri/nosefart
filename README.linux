To compile nosefart for linux, run "make" in the top of the source tree.

If you want to be able access /dev/dsp as an ordinary user, nosefart may need 
to be suid root.  To set that, run "chmod +s /usr/local/bin/nosefart" as root.
Don't do that unless you trust your users, because nosefart isn't secure yet.

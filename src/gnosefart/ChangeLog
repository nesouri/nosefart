1.4 - 22 Sept 2005

Now handles spaces in filenames (how embarrassing that it didn't!).

Handles bad files more gracefully.

1.3 - 20 Sept 2005

The file selection dialog now remember what directory you used in the
last session (using ~/.gnosefart).

If esd (or something else) is blocking the sound card, it now pops up 
an error rather than just hanging.

1.2 - 13 Sept 2005

Default changed to 2 repetitions (from forever).

New version of GTK (I think) causes line breaks in the status bar
to not work.  "Fixed" by restricting output to one line.  This
removes some of the interesting information, but I don't have the
energy to code a better fix.

1.1 - ?? May 2004

File selection behavior improved.

Song info is now displayed.

Other minor fixes.


1.0 - 23 Apr 2004 

Now reads from the backend and displays the number of tracks, the
current time and the total time.

Improved behavior of spinbuttons.

Help and About can be brought up multiple times now.

The main window is no longer resizable.

Recognizes when it can't play and complains.

Adds itself to the system menu, at least in Redhat 9.


0.9 - 16 Apr 2004

Initial release.
